  "Go on!",
  "I said 'move!'",
  "You, Citizen! Come with me.",
  "Back up!",
  "Get in!",
  "No, I'm good.",
  "Yeah, I'm gonna need me some privacy for this!",
  "Now... about that beer I owed ya.",
  "It's me, Gordon! Barney from Black Mesa.",
  "Hey, sorry for the scare. I had to put on a show for the cameras.",
  "I've been working undercover with Civil Protection. I can't take too long or they'll get suspicious. I'm way behind on my beating quota.",
  "Sorry, Doc, but look who's here.",
  "Yeah, you and me both, Doc.",
  "He was about to board the Express to Nova Prospekt.",
  "I'm thinking, I'm thinking.",
  "Well, as long as he stays away from checkpoints we should be okay.",
  "Listen, I gotta go, Doc. We're taking enough chances as it is.",
  "Okay, Gordon you're gonna have to make your own way to Dr. Kleiner's lab.",
  "Oh man, that's what I was afraid of. Get in here, Gordon, before you blow my cover.",
  "Pile up some stuff to get through that window, and keep going 'til you're in the plaza.",
  "I'll meet up with you later.",
  "There's no time to waste here, Gordon. Get a move on!",
  "They're right outside, get going!",
  "Hey, move it now, will you?",
  "Will you get going?",
  "Move it along!",
  "Get going, Gordon!",
  "Hurry up!",
  "We can't keep him here long, Doc.",
  "It'll jeopardize everything we've worked for.",
  "I can't look.",
  "Careful!",
  "Be careful!",
  "Okay, I don't blame you for hesitating, but if we're gonna do this thing, then let's just get through it.",
  "Don't worry, Gordon, we'll-",
  "Forget about that thing!",
  "Gee, thanks.",
  "Gordon, get a move on.",
  "Damn it!",
  "Get it off me!",
  "Get down outta sight!",
  "I'll come find you!",
  "Get your suit on, Gordon.",
  "Good luck out there, Gordon.",
  "Ugh!",
  "It's your pet, the freakin' head-humper!",
  "Look out!",
  "Man, Gordon! You stirred up the hive.",
  "Hey, hey, he's back!",
  "I'm getting him outta there!",
  "Well, is he here?",
  "You mean it's working? For real this time? Becauseâ€” I still have nightmares about that cat.",
  "At least get that suit juiced up, Gordon.",
  "Yeah, longer if we're lucky.",
  "Ha, I've gotta get back on my shift.",
  "But okay.",
  "Doc, we don't have time for this!",
  "Come on, Gordon.",
  "We don't have time to fool around. Get your suit on.",
  "And not a moment too soon.",
  "Doc, since he's not taking the streets, you might as well get him out of his civvies.",
  "You're pissin' me off, Gordon.",
  "You're pushin' it Gordon.",
  "That's what you said last time.",
  "Good job, Gordon.",
  "Throwing that switch and all?",
  "I can see your M.I.T. education really pays for itself.",
  "Time to suit up, Gordon.",
  "I thought you got rid of that pest!",
  "There he is!",
  "There you are!",
  "Here we go...",
  "Aaah!",
  "Get that thing away from me!",
  "This way, Gordon.",
  "What the hell?",
  "Whoops!",
  "Hey, Gordon!",
  "The Citadel's on full alert! I've never seen it lit up like that.",
  "Get out of City 17 as fast as you can, Gordon!",
  "Take the old canals, right? They'll get you to Eli's lab. It's a dangerous route, but there's a whole network of refugees and they'll help you if they can.",
  "I'd come with you, but I've got to look after Dr. Kleiner.",
  "Oh, and before I forget. I think you dropped this back in Black Mesa.",
  "Good luck out there, buddy. You're gonna need it.",
  "Go on, get going!",
  "Well man, that's good news.",
  "I almost gave you guys up for lost!",
  "I'll take all the help I can get.",
  "We're planning to set up a staging area for attacking the Citadel.",
  "Hey, Doc? Are you there?",
  "Doc, come in, are you there?",
  "Oh crap! Incoming!",
  "Gordon, I can't move. These snipers got me pinned down.",
  "Let me get this gate. My Civil Protection status still gives me limited clearance.",
  "It's good to see ya, Gordon. It'll be good to have your help goin' into the nexus up ahead.",
  "That damn thing haunts me.",
  "Watch the headhumpers, Gordon.",
  "Did you hear a cat just now?",
  "Hey, come on!",
  "All right, thanks, Gordon. Now let's clear outta here.",
  "Let's get going.",
  "The grenades, Gordon!",
  "Hey, look at the grenades, would ya?",
  "How about a grenade, Gordon?",
  "Gordon, lob a couple grenades, that'll clear 'em out.",
  "Gordon! Grenades!",
  "That's one down, one to go, buddy!",
  "Over here!",
  "You're quite the returning hero these days, Gordon.",
  "Gordon, take out these snipers, would ya?!",
  "That's it! They're all down.",
  "They'll be coming from the roof.",
  "Done.",
  "First, we gotta get into the Nexus building.",
  "There's that gate I was telling you about. We'll have to come back here after we get it open. If we get it open.",
  "Let's head for the roof now, Gordon.",
  "If any more citizens come through, I'll send them up to find you.",
  "Great, I'll open this up.",
  "I'm gonna stay here and keep these gates open long enough to make a difference.",
  "Wow. With that much security, there must be something good in there. Go for it, Doc. I'll wait here till you shut it down. Be careful.",
  "One generator to go.",
  "There's an old building up ahead, a bank or museum or something like that. Whatever the hell it used to be, now it's a nexus for Overwatch in City Seventeen. It's the main source of pain for this part of town, thanks to a huge suppression device that's raining down hell from the roof of the place.",
  "There's our gate. Let me just get it open.",
  "Oh man. Overwatch owns the roof, and that's where we're headed.",
  "Prisoners! Let 'em out, Gordon. We could use their help.",
  "Roll a grenade in there if you've got one. That oughtta do it.",
  "Roof access is this way.",
  "See you when I see you, Gordon.",
  "Set some traps for them, Gordon.",
  "If we want to get through these shields, we'll have to take out the generators one at a time.",
  "Go on up and connect the skybridge. We need to let reinforcements come through from every possible direction.",
  "So much for stealth. We've been spotted!",
  "You're not gonna hurt that thing from down here, Gordon. We'll have to shut it down from inside.",
  "That'll shut down the suppressor on the roof as well.",
  "We're surrounded!",
  "Then let's go!",
  "We've got three generators to disable. Might as well start with this one.",
  "To the roof, Gordon!",
  "Uh-oh. Turrets. You've got the HEV Suit, you deal with them. Then I'll work the security console.",
  "Okay, two more generators to go.",
  "Uh oh. Dropships!",
  "Try using the Hoppers against 'em.",
  "There it is. The Overwatch Nexus. Looks like they're mobilizing, big-time. You can sort of see the gate from here. I'll show you when we get to streetlevel.",
  "We'll have to get in that building to open the gate. Even then, the suppression device will, uh, suppress anyone coming through unless we shut it down.",
  "Hey, you've got Eli's gravity gun! Try giving those shields a jolt and see if you can shake 'em up a bit.",
  "Here boy, Dog! Come back here, Dog!",
  "Damn it all!",
  "I think he wants you to go through, Gordon. You'd better hurry.",
  "Gordon!",
  "Hey! Help me out here!",
  "Well, I'll be damned.",
  "Dog came crashing through the plaza, knocking over walls and... I think he's looking for Alyx. He seems to have it set in his head that she's in the Citadel.",
  "Go on through, Gordon.",
  "Better get going, Gordon.",
  "I'll hold 'em off. You'd better get going.",
  "Go on!",
  "Hey, go!",
  "Hey, Dog! Not there! You can't get through that way!",
  "And if you see Dr. Breen, tell him I said, 'Fu----ou!' (Censored in-game by the sound of the Combine Barricade being dropped by Dog.)",
  "I figured Alyx wouldn't want him getting any deeper in trouble, but... Hell, you try stopping him!",
  "Bring it on!",
  "Cover me, Gordon.",
  "Damn it!",
  "I don't like the looks of this.",
  "Down you go.",
  "Duck!",
  "This way, Gordon.",
  "Come on!",
  "Come on, Gordon!",
  "Follow me.",
  "Get away from there.",
  "Get down!",
  "Hey, get out of the way!",
  "You're going down!",
  "Gordon! Help!",
  "Got one! (Originally used in Half-Life)",
  "Grenade!",
  "Grenade!",
  "Headhumpers!",
  "Here it comes!",
  "Here they come!",
  "Hurry up.",
  "I'm with ya, buddy.",
  "Haha!",
  "Hahaha ha ha!",
  "He-yeah-he-heah!",
  "Hahaha ha haa!",
  "Let's do it.",
  "Let's go!",
  "Little help here, Gordon?",
  "Look out!",
  "I haven't lost my touch!",
  "No!",
  "No!",
  "Oh shit!",
  "Oh yeah!",
  "Just like old times, eh, Gordon?",
  "Open fire, Gordon!",
  "Soldiers!",
  "Turret!",
  "Uh oh, here they come!",
  "I'm hurtin', Gordon.",
  "I need to get patched up.",
  "I'm hurt pretty bad...",
  "Yeah!",
  "There's supposed to be a high route over the rooftops, but... I've never been that way myself.",
  "It's all clear, thanks to Gordon.",
  "One down!",
  "All right! One more now! Come on, Gordon!",
  "Hey, it's an armory.",
  "Now we can cut through the square, bypass the Nexus and push straight on toward the Citadel.",
  "They're coming down.",
  "All in a day's work, right?",
  "Don't let it see you!",
  "Don't let it catch you standing still!",
  "It draws power from inside the building so that's where we've got to go.",
  "Look for the exit signs.",
  "This way, Gordon.",
  "Come on!",
  "Come on, Gordon.",
  "Follow me.",
  "Get this thing open, Gordon.",
  "Good job, Gordon.",
  "Go on now.",
  "We've gotta get the skybridge open.",
  "Great work, Doc, you've still got the touch.",
  "Let them out!",
  "Good. Now, get the skybridge connected.",
  "Gordon, extend the skybridge.",
  "They're on the roof!",
  "Good job, Gordon. I'll see you on the ground.",
  "Check out those shield generators. I've got nothing to deal with those. What we need here is some kind of action at a distance.",
  "Stock up!",
  "It spotted us!",
  "The suppressor's down, so you can get to the roof now.",
  "Uh oh. Company.",
  "I wish Eli were here. Maybe he'd have some advice for us.",
  "Uh oh. I'll stay here. You hurry on. Good luck up there, Gordon!",
  "All clear!",
  "Let me catch my breath.",
  "Clear for now.",
  "Come here.",
  "Come here.",
  "I smell an ambush.",
  "I have a bad feeling about this.",
  "Hey, remember when we thought Black Mesa was as bad as it could get?",
  "Hard to believe we made it this far with all our parts.",
  "Gah!",
  "Ugh!",
  "Ooh!",
  "Let's do it!",
  "Ew! Headcrabs!",
  "Headcrabs!",
  "Yeah, that's better.",
  "Okay, I'm good.",
  "Much better.",
  "Hey, thanks.",
  "Hey, patch me up.",
  "Help me out.",
  "Can I get a little medical attention here?",
  "Hurry.",
  "Hurry!",
  "Hurry!",
  "Oh shit!",
  "Oh shit!",
  "Over here!",
  "Over here!",
  "Regroup!",
  "That was close!",
  "That was close!",
  "This is bad.",
  "Okay, this is bad."
